## What is papaja

`papaja` is an R package written by Frederick Aust & Marius Barth.

`papaja` provides an R Markdown template for writing APA papers that can be compiled to .pdf or word document formats

## papaja documentation

The documentation for using papaja is here 

> - <https://crsh.github.io/papaja_man/>
> - as a sidenote, this is also an online book written in R markdown and compiled with the `bookdown` package
  
## Installing papaja

> 1. Make sure you have `devtools` installed. `papaja` is not on CRAN, and we use devtools to install the package from Github.

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
install.packages("devtools")
```
  
> 2. Install Latex (for rendering to pdf). Note, rather than installing a full distribution, we can use the `tinytex` package which will install the components we need as we need them.

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
install.packages("tinytex")
tinytex::install_tinytex()
```

> 3. Install `papaja`

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
devtools::install_github("crsh/papaja")
```

## Writing an APA paper with papaja

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/papaja/rmdTopdf.png")
```

## papaja process diagram

```{r, out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/papaja/compilation_process.png")
```

## A Walkthrough

> 1. Let's go through the papaja documentation
> 2. And, look at the example `manuscript.Rmd` file in the `manuscript/` folder.

## Additional considerations/tips

> 1. set classoption to "man" for double-spaced draft style, or to "jou" for two-column apa-journal style.

> 2. We recommend placing raw data in the `data-raw` folder, and including a pre-processing script showing how the data is loaded into R. In this example, I also added the resulting dataframe to the R package for this tutorial, and then loaded the package in the manuscript to load the pre-processed data.

> 3. There other many strategies for creating a reproducible analysis. A large paper may have many code chunks and become unwieldly. It is possible to run the analysis scripts outside of the main document. For example, an analysis script might save R variables in an .RData or .Rda file, which can then be loaded in the main manuscript for reporting.
